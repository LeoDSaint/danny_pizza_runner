## 1. What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?

```sql
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT * 
    FROM pizza_names AS pz
    LEFT JOIN pizza_recipes_splits AS prs
    ON pz.pizza_id = prs.pizza_id
),
cte2 AS (
SELECT pizza_name, topping_name
FROM cte
LEFT JOIN pizza_toppings AS pz
ON cte.toppings= pz.topping_id
ORDER BY  1 )


SELECT pizza_name,STRING_AGG(topping_name, ', ') AS vegetarian_ingredients
FROM cte2
GROUP BY 1;
```

* The standard ingredients for Meatlovers pizza are bacon, bbq sauce, beef, cheese, chicken, mushrooms, pepperoni, and salami.
* The standard ingredients for Vegetarian pizza are cheese, mushrooms, onions, peppers, tomatoes, and tomato sauce.

## 2. What was the most commonly added extra?

```sql
SELECT 
    extras, -- Select the values in the "extras" column
    COUNT(*) AS count, -- Count the occurrences of each value
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rank -- Assign a rank based on the count in descending order
FROM 
    customer_orders_ -- From the "customer_orders_" table
WHERE 
    extras IS NOT NULL -- Filter out null values in the "extras" column
GROUP BY 
    1; -- Group the results by the first column (extras)


SELECT topping_name
FROM pizza_toppings
WHERE topping_id = '1';
```
* The most commonly added extra is Bacon.

## 3. What was the most common exclusion?

```sql
SELECT 
    exclusions, -- Select the values in the "extras" column
    COUNT(*) AS count, -- Count the occurrences of each value
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS rank -- Assign a rank based on the count in descending order
FROM 
    customer_orders_ -- From the "customer_orders_" table
WHERE 
    exclusions IS NOT NULL -- Filter out null values in the "extras" column
GROUP BY 
    1; -- Group the results by the first column (extras)

SELECT topping_name
FROM pizza_toppings
WHERE topping_id = '4';
```
* The most common exclusion is Cheese.

## 4. Generate an order item for each record in the customers_orders table in the format of one of the following:
- Meat Lovers
- Meat Lovers - Exclude Beef
- Meat Lovers - Extra Bacon
- Meat Lovers - Exclude Cheese, Bacon - Extra Mushroom, Peppers

```sql
-- 4. This query will return distinct combinations of pizza_id, exclusions, and extras from the customer_orders table. Each row in the result set will represent a unique combination of these three columns.

SELECT DISTINCT pizza_id, exclusions, extras
FROM customer_orders;

SELECT 
		order_id,
		customer_id,
		pizza_id,
		customer_orders.exclusions,
		extras,
		CASE 
    WHEN customer_orders.pizza_id = 1 AND customer_orders.exclusions IS NULL AND extras IS NULL THEN 'MeatLovers'
    WHEN customer_orders.pizza_id = 2 AND customer_orders.exclusions IS NULL AND extras IS NULL THEN 'Vegetarian'
    WHEN customer_orders.pizza_id = 1 AND customer_orders.exclusions = '4' AND extras IS NULL THEN 'MeatLovers Exclude Cheese'
    WHEN customer_orders.pizza_id = 1 AND customer_orders.exclusions IS NULL AND extras = '1' THEN 'MeatLovers Extra Bacon' 
    WHEN customer_orders.pizza_id = 2 AND customer_orders.exclusions = '4' AND extras IS NULL THEN 'Vegetarian'
    WHEN customer_orders.pizza_id = 2 AND customer_orders.exclusions IS NULL AND extras = '1' THEN 'Vegetarian Extra Bacon'
    WHEN customer_orders.pizza_id = 1 AND customer_orders.exclusions = '4' AND extras = '1, 5' THEN 'MeatLovers Exclude Cheese - Extra Bacon, Chicken'
    WHEN customer_orders.pizza_id = 1 AND customer_orders.exclusions = '2, 6' AND extras = '1, 4' THEN 'MeatLovers Exclude BBQ Sauce, Mushroom - Extras Bacon, Cheese'
END AS order_item

FROM customer_orders
ORDER BY order_time;
```
